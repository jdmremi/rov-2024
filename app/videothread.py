class VideoThread(QThread):
    """
    VideoThread is a QThread subclass designed to handle video capture and processing in a separate thread. 
    It emits a signal with the captured video frames and provides utility methods for converting frames 
    to QPixmap and saving screenshots.

    Attributes:
        change_pixmap_signal (pyqtSignal): Signal emitted with a numpy array representing the video frame.
        __run_flag (bool): Internal flag to control the thread's execution.
        __display_width (int): Width of the display for scaling the video frames.
        __display_height (int): Height of the display for scaling the video frames.
        __recent_frame (np.ndarray): Stores the most recent video frame captured.

    Methods:
        __init__(width, height):
            Initializes the VideoThread with the specified display width and height.

        run():
            Starts the video capture loop, emitting frames via the change_pixmap_signal.
            Captures video from the default webcam (device 0).

        stop():
            Stops the video capture loop and waits for the thread to finish.

        convert_cv_qt(cv_img):
            Converts an OpenCV image (numpy array) to a QPixmap for display in a PyQt application.

        save_screenshot(path="./rov_images/"):
            Saves the most recent video frame as a screenshot to the specified directory.
